Early November in 2023, we kickstarted [SEACrowd](https://github.com/SEACrowd), a community movement project aimed at centralizing and standardizing AI resources for Southeast Asian languages, cultures, and/or regions.

**Why Is It Important?**
It is essential to greatly increase the accessibility of SEA datasets, promote research in SEA languages and cultures, as well as build more AI models that represent SEA.

**Contributing to SEACrowd**
*Everyone* can join and contribute to this initiative from 1 November 2023 to 31 March 2024, win some SWAG, and become a co-author of our upcoming paper. We aim to publish the results of our findings in AACL/EMNLP 2024.

This movement is co-initiated and maintained by a team of passionate researchers in SEA, low-resource, and/or underrepresented languages NLP.
