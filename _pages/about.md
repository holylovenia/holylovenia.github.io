I'm pursuing an MPhil at [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) and working on NLP research as a part of [Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAiRE)](https://pascale.home.ece.ust.hk/team.html).

Before coming to Hong Kong, I was first introduced to research in Summer 2018, when I became a research intern in [AHC Lab](https://ahcweb01.naist.jp/en/) at [Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Japan](http://www.naist.jp/en/), working on brain signal processing research. The next year, I got my Bachelor's degree from the undergraduate program of Computer Science at [Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), Indonesia](https://itb.ac.id/). Then, from 2019 to 2021, I worked on various projects regarding NLP, speech synthesis, and paralinguistics with [Prosa.ai](https://prosa.ai/).

As of now, I'm exploring more in the field of multimodality (vision-language), multilinguality, and conversational AI.
