I'm currently working for [SEACrowd](https://seacrowd.github.io/), a non-profit community dedicated to bridging the gap between multilingual AI and Southeast Asian AI and enhancing the quality of AI research and researchers in the region.

#### Previously

- I was a Senior Research Engineer at [AI Singapore ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬](https://aisingapore.org/) in the field of multilingualism in Southeast Asian languages and for Southeast Asian regions.

- ðŸŽ“ I got my MPhil degree from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong ðŸ‡­ðŸ‡°](https://hkust.edu.hk/). I worked on vision-language & NLP research as a part of the [Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research (CAiRE)](https://pascale.home.ece.ust.hk/team.html) in 2021-2023.

- Concurrently, I also joined [ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡© IndoNLP](https://github.com/IndoNLP) and have been active in NLP research in Indonesian indigenous languages (e.g., NusaCrowd, NusaWrites, etc.) since 2021.

- Before coming to Hong Kong, I was first introduced to research in the summer of 2018, when I became a research intern in [AHC Lab](https://ahcweb01.naist.jp/en/) at [Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ](http://www.naist.jp/en/), working on brain signal processing research.

- ðŸŽ“ The next year, I got my Bachelor's degree from the undergraduate program of Computer Science at [Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©](https://itb.ac.id/).

- Then, from 2019 to 2021, I worked on various projects regarding NLP, speech synthesis, and paralinguistics with [Prosa.ai, Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©](https://prosa.ai/).


#### Interests

As of now, I'm researching in the fields of multimodality (vision-language), multilingualism, and conversational AI.
